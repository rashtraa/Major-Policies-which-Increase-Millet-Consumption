Major Policies to Increase Millet Consumption
This project provides an in-depth analysis of millet consumption trends and related government policies in India. Millets, as sustainable and nutritionally rich alternatives to common grains, are crucial for addressing food and nutrition security challenges. This study examines historical consumption patterns and expenditures to provide data-backed policy recommendations.

Introduction
Millets, a group of small-seeded grains, are highly resilient and require minimal resources to cultivate. Despite their traditional importance and nutritional value, their consumption has declined due to the focus on wheat and rice post-Green Revolution. This project investigates the factors influencing this decline and highlights the renewed focus on millets, particularly in light of recent governmental and international initiatives.

Literary Review
A review of existing literature reveals a persistent decline in per capita millet consumption in both rural and urban areas until recent years. Factors contributing to this trend include long cooking times, lack of value-added products, and policy biases favoring other cereals. Recent studies, however, show a growing interest in millets due to increased health awareness.

Data Source
The primary data for this study was sourced from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey (NSS) for the years 2009-10, 2011-12, 2022-23, and 2023-24. Additional data on millet exports and per capita consumption was compiled from the Indian Institute of Millets Research. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.

Discussion & Results
The analysis shows significant variations in millet consumption across different Indian states. States with arid climates, such as Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, show a higher consumption percentage of millets, while states with fertile river basins like Assam, Bihar, and West Bengal show a much lower share.

Historical trends from 1960 to 2022 reveal that while wheat and rice consumption has steadily increased, millet consumption has remained relatively constant since the 1980s. A recent marginal increase in consumption expenditure on millets is noted in 2023-24, likely influenced by the declaration of the International Year of Millets.

Conclusion
Millets offer a path towards a sustainable and nutritionally secure food system. While historical policy biases and market trends have led to their underutilization, recent policy changes and increasing public awareness have begun to reverse this trend. A multi-faceted approach involving policy, technology, and market development is required to fully integrate millets into the national diet.

Policy Recommendations
The following policies are recommended to boost millet consumption in India:

Boosting Production Efficiency: Provide subsidies and high-yielding variety (HYV) seeds to incentivize millet cultivation.

Inclusion in Public Distribution System (PDS): Actively procure millets and distribute them through the PDS to ensure they are affordable and accessible to all consumers.

Adequate Resource Allotment for R&D: Promote research to develop better-yielding, more nutritious, and pest-resistant millet varieties.

Technology Advancement: Encourage GI tagging for indigenous millets and launch regional branding campaigns.

Massive Awareness Campaigns: Utilize various media platforms to promote millets as a "smart food" for health and sustainability.

Mandating Millets in Government Institutions: Make millet-based items mandatory in government canteens, army rations, school meals, and Anganwadi programs.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): Collaborate with FMCG brands and support startups to create attractive, ready-to-eat millet products.
